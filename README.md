# Web Workshop One Starter Files

Here's a base for the structure of the site we'll be building together.

It's a very simple Flask mini-app that displays a bit of info about you as a student. During the workshop, we'll modify app.py to let you fetch data from the backend and from an external API!

The "end-goal" files are in /end, but we'll be ignoring that for now. :)
